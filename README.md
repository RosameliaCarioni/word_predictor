# Word Predictor  üîç

The word predictor allows users to speed the typing process by providing with suggestions to autocomplete what they are writting. The system is designed to predict the next word as you type, enhancing typing efficiency in text messages, emails, and other text inputs. This project includes various models such as N-gram, RNN, and Transformer to provide accurate word predictions.

## Features

### Functionality
As you type in the text input field, the word predictor displays a list of the most probable completions of the current word. This list updates with each keystroke. You can select a suggested word to autocomplete the text, saving time and effort.

### Settings
- **Prediction Model**: Choose between N-gram, RNN, and Transformer models.
- **Number of suggestions**: Set the maximum number of suggestions displayed. - TODO: would be cool

### Models 
- **N-gram**: Implements a basic probabilistic model based on the occurrence frequency of word sequences. - TODO: add more
- **RNN**: Utilizes Recurrent Neural Networks to handle sequential data and context, more specifically GRU is implemented. TODO: add more 
- **Transformer**: TODO 

## Data
The project uses various datasets to train the models. Below are the details of each dataset:

| Name               | Type                     | Size     | Link                                                                |

### Preprocessing 
All datasets were pre-processed to clean and standardize the text data. The preprocessing scripts are available in the `data_processing/` directory, and the cleaned datasets can be [downloaded here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13o4l--P29W-vunAA241gp_zDWu0SOxJF/view?usp=sharing). You should unzip them and store them in the main directory in the path `data/clean_data/`.

## File Structure 
The project directory is organized as follows:  
- **`data_processing/`**: Includes Jupyter notebooks used to clean and preprocess the datasets.
- 
- **`images/`**: Contains images of the contributors, used for the web app.

- **`models/`**: Contains model training scripts and pre-trained weights.
  - **`training/`**: Directory with scripts for training the models and storing their weights.
  - **`n_gram.py`**: N-gram model handler.
  - **`rnn.py`**: RNN model handler.
  - **`transformer.py`**: Transformer model handler.
